# Computer Vision Project

The task for this project is to create a simple Rock, Paper, Scissors game to be played against the computer, where the player's input is given through the webcam and interpreted by a computer vision model. The computer vision model will be generated by the online Teachable Machine service provided by Google, and the logic of the game will be coded in Python.

# Milestone 1

The task for the first milestone is to generate the model that will be used to interpret the player's input and download it into the local environment. The model should be able to distinguish between the player showing either rock, paper, scissors, or nothing. The online Teachable Machine service is used to generate the model. 

Insert image

I used approximately 500 training images for each of the data categories, generated by showing the respective symbols in various orientations to the camera.

Once the model was generated, its constituent files were downloaded and placed in the `model` folder of this Github repository.

# Milestone 2

The first task for this milestone is to create a new conda conda environment and install in it the necessary libraries to run the model I have generated.
